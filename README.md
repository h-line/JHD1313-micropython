# Micropython driver for JHD1313 based LCD displays

Partially ported from a C library by Seeed Studio with clarifications from the datasheet. Both available [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-16x2_LCD_Series/).

Tested with Micropython on Raspberry Pi Pico with Grove 16x2 LCD display. Works for my personal purposes, but comes with no warranty of any kind.
